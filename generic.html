										<h1>Day 1: A Fresh Start</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Hello, World!</p>
									<p>My name is Jose Ramirezz, a budding developer, and a Computer Science student at Boston University. Today marks the beginning of a four-month-long journey of self-guided exploration, skill acquisition, and project-based learning. My aim? To level up my developer skills during this break before I return for my next semester..</p>
									<p>I've just completed my first semester at BU, where I dipped my toes into the vast ocean of coding through CS 111, an intensive course teaching the fundamentals of programming using Python. It's been an enlightening experience, and now, I'm ready to delve deeper.</p>
									<p>The next course in line for me at BU is CS 112, which primarily focuses on Java. The fascinating part is that the entire curriculum for this course is available online! This gives me the perfect opportunity to get a head start and familiarize myself with Java over the summer.</p>
									<p>Today, I embarked on this journey of transitioning from Python to Java. I watched 12 instructional videos that detailed the major differences and nuances between the two languages. While Python and Java are fundamentally different in many ways, understanding these differences is key to becoming a polyglot programmer.</p>
									<p>But here's the catch. This summer isn't just about learning; it's also about creating. As my first real project, I've decided to build a website. A platform where I can document my progress, share my experiences, and showcase my projects.</p>
									<p>Day one of this project was all about laying the foundation. I decided to go for a quick and efficient approach, by deploying a template website. With a helpful YouTube tutorial as my guide and GitHub Pages as my platform, I successfully set up the basic structure of my site. The simplicity of GitHub Pages allowed me to focus more on the content, rather than the nuts and bolts of web hosting.</p>
									<p>And that’s it for day one! This journey has just begun, and I’m excited about the road ahead. Each day, I'll be sharing my progress, my wins, my challenges, and my learnings. I look forward to seeing where this journey takes me, and I hope you'll join me along the way.</p>
									<p>Stay tuned!</p>

										<h1>Day 2: Java Journey Continues, Website WIP, and a Dip into Git</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic12.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Hello again, fellow developers and curious readers!</p>
									<p>As I embarked on the second day of my self-guided learning journey, I dove deeper into CS 112, continuing my exploration of Java. My day was filled with lab exercises that helped me get accustomed to Java's distinct syntax and the Visual Studio Code environment.</p>
									<p>Java, as I'm quickly finding out, is indeed a verbose language, especially compared to Python. The exercises today mostly involved identifying syntax errors and understanding the key differences between Python and Java. Though it was challenging, I truly believe in the "learn by doing" approach. It's a bit like learning a new musical instrument: unfamiliar at first, but with practice, the notes start to make sense.</p>
									<p>While learning Java has been my primary academic focus, I've been equally excited about my website project. Today, I made some significant progress in decluttering the site. I've always been a believer in simplicity and functionality over frills, and I wanted my website to reflect that. So, I stripped it down to its bare essentials, focusing on making it a hub for this developer blog.</p>
									<p>Is it a masterpiece? Not quite. But it's a starting point, and every great journey begins with a single step. I'll be dedicating a little time each day to refine and improve it, and I'm excited to see it evolve along with my skills.</p>
									<p>The last noteworthy milestone of the day was getting started with Git and GitHub. I've always heard how crucial version control is in any software development process, and now, I'm beginning to see why. The concept of managing and tracking changes in code is fascinating, and though it's a steep learning curve, I'm eager to master it.</p>
									<p>In tandem with Git, I also dabbled a bit with command line operations. I learned some basic commands, which, despite their simplicity, felt quite empowering. It's like learning a secret language that lets you communicate directly with your computer.</p>
									<p>And that's a wrap for day two! It was a day filled with new concepts, challenges, and victories. As I continue this journey, I'm reminded that the road to mastery is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
									<p>Stay tuned for more updates, and happy coding!</p>
